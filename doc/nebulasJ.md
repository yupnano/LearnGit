    @Test
    public void testGetNebState() {
        Response<NebState> response = nebulasClient.getNebState();
        System.out.println(response);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetAccountState() {
        Response<AccountState> response = nebulasClient.getAccountState(new GetAccountStateRequest("n1Z6SbjLuAEXfhX1UJvXT6BB5osWYxVg3F3"));
        System.out.println(response);
